# Mohs Hardness Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning regression model for predicting Mohs hardness based on specific input features. Mohs hardness is a measure of the hardness of a mineral, indicating its resistance to scratching. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various minerals with known Mohs hardness values.
