PROBLEM STATEMENT: PREDICTION OF MOHS HARDNESS WITH MACHINE LEARNING

The problem addressed in this study revolves around predicting the Mohs hardness of minerals using a machine learning approach. Hardness, a critical property in materials design, is non-destructively assessed through hardness testing. The study proposes a model that integrates atomic and electronic features derived from composition across various mineral compositions and crystal systems. The dataset, sourced from experimental Mohs hardness data, crystal classes, and chemical compositions of minerals, consists of 369 uniquely named minerals. Compositional permutations were performed to handle multiple composition combinations for minerals with the same name, resulting in a database of 622 minerals.
